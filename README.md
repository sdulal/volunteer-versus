# Volunteer Versus

Volunteer Versus is an online application that allows volunteering organizations to better manage hours. Club officers simply check off members for events so that members can get hours credited. Through a leaderboard system, users and groups are able to see exactly who volunteers the most, which club has the most members, etc.

This application runs *Ruby on Rails 4.2.0*.
